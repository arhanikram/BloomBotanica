**BloomBotanica** is an Android app designed to simplify plant care for busy individuals who struggle to keep track of the unique needs of each plant. From succulents to flowering plants and cacti, each plant has its own specific requirements to stay healthy and vibrant. BloomBotanica aims to be a reliable assistant for plant owners, providing timely reminders and an organized interface that ensures each plant receives the right care at the right time. With BloomBotanica, users can easily manage watering schedules, view a history of plant care, and record observations for each plant, helping prevent common care mistakes and keeping their plants happy and thriving.

### Currently Implemented

- **Onboarding**:
  - The app begins with an onboarding screen where users enter their name, which is saved in `SharedPreferences` for personalized messages.
- **Dashboard**:
  - A `DashboardFragment` displays a welcome message that includes the userâ€™s name and a RecyclerView list of daily plant care tasks.
  - (__*Layout is there but tasks and backend are not yet implemented*__)
- **Plant List**:
  - The `PlantsFragment` displays plants in a RecyclerView as square cards in a grid layout. Users can add new plants to their collection, which are saved in the database, and view all plants in the list. Users can also delete plants from their collection.

- **Calendar View**:
  - `CalendarFragment` integrates a calendar view that highlights dates with scheduled plant care tasks
  - (__*not fully implemented, only have calendar with placeholder icons*__).
- **Persistent Data Storage**:
  - Utilizes a Room database to save user-added plants and their care schedules, ensuring data persists across app sessions.

  - A dedicated view for each plant displays its nickname and an image. While users cannot yet view the care schedule or care history, the backend for watering date updates is nearly complete.
- **Add Plant**:
  - Users can add plants from the Plant List, choosing a plant nickname and selecting what plant it is based on our Plant Care Database.
- **Plant Suggestions**:
  - Provides name suggestions when adding a plant, querying a database of plant information.
